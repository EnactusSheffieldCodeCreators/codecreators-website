This course is currently in the process of being refined after our initial pilot run at the start of 2021. We will return in 2022, send us an [email](mailto:codecreators@enactussheffield.org) and we'll contact you when the course opens again.

# Overview

This year CodeCreators are happy to announce the launch of our advanced course! The advance course builds on what is taught in the beginners course, and aims take foundational knowledge and teach real world application to ensure students know how to maximise their skills. We cover subjects such as web scraping, API, and object orientation. This course has a live lecture at 6pm on a wednesday, which is recorded in case you miss it, and a drop in session held at 1pm on a Sunday. The course is open for students as well as non-students.
