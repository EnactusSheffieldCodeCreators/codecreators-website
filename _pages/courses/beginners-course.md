# Overview

An 8 week introductory course to Python, ideal with those with little to no prior programming experience. By commiting only 2 hours per week, you will learn all the skills you need to start making your own Python projects! Sessions are held on Sundays at 1pm, and are recorded for students who miss a live session. Attending all the lectures will be rewarded with a certificate of completion, and handing in the final project will be rewarded with a certificate of commendation.
